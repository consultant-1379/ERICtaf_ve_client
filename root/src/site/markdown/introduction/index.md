#Eiffel Visualization Engine (Client)


##Introduction
The Visualization Engine is a client side web application that is loaded on a web browser. The user can configure the client to display Eiffel event information in real time or its previous history. The Visualization Engine contains some predefined visualizations but also it has its own pluggable interface so more can be added. Once the user subscribes to Eiffel event information it is then streamed to the client. 

 All Eiffel messages are processed by the server and sent to the client for visualisation purposes upon request. The server itself is also pluggable and therefore new model configurations can be added along with client plugins. Please see the server's eiffel portal for more information.
