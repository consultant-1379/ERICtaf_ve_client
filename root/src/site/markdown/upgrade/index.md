# Eiffel Visualization Engine Client

## Upgrade

1. Visit the [Eiffel Nexus](https://eiffel.lmera.ericsson.se/nexus/content/repositories/releases/com/ericsson/duraci/VisualizationEngineApp/) and select the version that you require.
2. Download the `VisualizationEngineApp-<version>.tar.gz` file.
3. Extract the tarball to a directory of your choice.
4. You now need to link the client to the VE Server.  Refer to the installation an configuration instructions on the [VE Server](https://eiffel.lmera.ericsson.se/com.ericsson.duraci/ve-server/index.html) page and point the server to: `<path-to-untar-location>/VisualizationEngineApp-<version>/package/VisualizationEngineApp`
6. Note: If your server was running during this process, you must restart it now.
